# Customer-Conversion-Prediction

This project is designed to predict customer conversion for companies, such as insurance firms. By leveraging historical data, we will develop a machine learning model capable of identifying customers who are most likely to purchase a policy. By analyzing the patterns and behaviors of previous customers, the model can generate predictions and offer valuable insights to the company. The goal is to enhance the rate of successful conversions, thereby improving the company's overall performance and profitability.
